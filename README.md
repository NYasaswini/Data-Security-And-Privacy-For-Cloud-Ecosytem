## About
Cloud computing has revolutionized the way businesses and individuals store, process, and access data. However, the rapid adoption of cloud services has raised significant concerns about data security and privacy. This abstract introduces a comprehensive cloud security ecosystem designed to address these critical issues in cloud computing environments. The Cloud Security Ecosystem is a holistic framework that encompasses various layers and components to safeguard data throughout its lifecycle in the cloud. It integrates a combination of technologies, best practices, and policies to mitigate risks and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. This Cloud Security Ecosystem acts as a proactive defense against emerging threats, ensuring that data remains secure and private in cloud computing environments. By implementing a layered approach that combines technology, processes, and personnel, organizations can navigate the complexities of cloud security while reaping the benefits of cloud computing. This abstract sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of these components and their interplay within the cloud security ecosystem, offering insights and strategies for achieving robust data security and privacy in the cloud

## Result
In this paper, we present a Hybrid Cryptographic System (HCS) that combines the benefits of both symmetric and asymmetric encryption. The Secure Cloud Ecosystem which we propose ensures data security and privacy by implementing different encryption techniques at various levels. The system also makes use of certain hashing and salting techniques which even strengthens the entire encryption process. During the design of our system we also made sure of trusted authentication thereby allowing the feature of One Time Password (OTP).
